# Rotary-encoder

This is the code used to control the two DC motors using shaft encoder and motor driver in a feedback loop along with the microcontroller here I used PID control method for better accuracy and efficiency. Here in this code we used arduino as the development kit to test my code and I biuld my own single PCB board of two layers which can help in interfacing an arduino with the motor as well as with the encoder. You can download the code for your test purposes
